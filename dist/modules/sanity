To learn:

Prototypal Inheritence
    * Why am I having trouble making an HTMLButtonElement of my own via prototypes?
    * this keyword is bad design
    * prototypes are bad design for an object-oriented ecosystem (which the browser APIs are)
    
Classes (definitely)
    * Required to make more complex systems that prototypal inheritence cannot create
    * Required to understand the modules page
    * Required to understand the `this` keyword in its entirety
    
Web components (definitely)
    * Required to understand frameworks
    
Asyncronous JavaScript
    * Required to fully understand the modules page
    * Required for a performant application
    * Required for applications of great complexity

React
    * A custom framework would do for a small app
    * Learn how existing frameworks operate before making one that does away with the bad and which keeps the good

Without these, JS is... AHHHH.
    * Unmaintainable
    * Poorly designed (still is even with these)
    * Not meant for complexity
    * Has learning resources that mainly constitute of poor writings as a result of JavaScript's poor design
