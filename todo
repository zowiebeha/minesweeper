🚧 Refactor current styling to be cleaner

🚧 Choose a new `game_win` image with correct center point and size

Animate the checkerboard to slowly move in one direction (disabled if user prefers reduced motion)

Learn Classes
    > Refactor code to be made with proper privacy
    > Refactor logic to be good
        - 🚧 flag bug with revealed tile (not sure how it happened)
    > Add more logic
        - visually indicate that bombs were successfully flagged on the death screen
        - reveal diagonal tiles if the current tile has no bombs adjacent to it so as to save the user from an extra click
        - Make the algorithm create puzzles that are solvable without random choices
